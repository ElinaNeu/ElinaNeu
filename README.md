### Hi there 👋


**About me**


- 🔭 I’m currently doing my Masters at LSE in Managment of Information Systems and Digital Innovation
- 🌱 I did an Data Analytics Course at Ironhack and will continue to challenge myself in the world of coding
- ⚡ Fun fact: I grew up in the mountains and love skiing and hiking and everything which has to do with extreme heights
